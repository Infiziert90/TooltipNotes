# TooltipNotesPlugin

A Simple Plugin which lets you add Notes to the tooltips of items (currently only in the descriptions).
Just right-click a item in you inventory to add a note or edit an existing one.
(Adding Notes based on itemID is currently only possible by editing the generated Notes.json)
